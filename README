AsyncmongoSession class, used to manage persistence across multiple requests. Uses
a mongodb backend and Cookies. This library is designed for use with
Tornado.

Built on top of asyncmongo by bit.ly - https://github.com/bitly/asyncmongo
The decorator is written to be completely asynchronous and not block.
Because of this some care should be taken to optimize your MongoDB
instance. Be sure to set an index on the "sid" key in your sessions
collection.

The session is added as session property to your request handler, ie:
self.session. It can be manipulated as your would any dictionary object.

Included with the library is a settings file, configured for default
permissions. Some of the more advanced tuning you can do is with token
expiration. In order to create some additional security for sessions used
in a non-ssl environment, the token stored in the browser rotates. If you
are using ssl, or more interested in performance than security you can set
SESSION_TOKEN_TTL to an extremely high number to avoid writes.

Note: In an effort increate performance, all writes are delayed until after the
request method has completed. 

Example:
    @tornado.web.asynchronous
    @asyncmongosession
    def get(self):
        if self.session.has_key("test"):
            self.session["test"] +=  1
        else:
            self.session["test"] = 0
        self.render("index.html", session=self.session)

IMPORTANT: If using the asynchronous wrapper from Tornado you must wrap
           the asyncmongosession with it, not the other way around. Otherwise
           it will error and not render because the request finish method
           will be called multiple times.
